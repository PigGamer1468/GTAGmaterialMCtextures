# GTAGmaterialMCtextures
Repo of all minecraft textures as a .gmat assetbundle for use with the Gorilla Cosmetics mod for Gorilla Tag

Use CTRL + F to pick out which ones you would like. Keep in mind you should not use any Transparent ones, I didn't have the time to remove those, but they may not work well.

DO NOT USE ALL OF THESE TOGETHER. this is 775 .gmat files, do not attempt to load all of them. 

Currently they may be washed out, as I had forgotten to apply an unlit shader during the export process. Expect an update soon.
